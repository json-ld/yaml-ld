      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document collects together use cases and requirments for YAML-LD.
        These use case were provided by members of the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">W3C JSON-LD Community Group</a>
        on the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-json-ld/"
                  >JSON-LD CG mailing list</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/yaml-ld/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aucr">issues</a>
        of the  community's GitHub repository.

        <h4>Compatibility with existing libraries</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/json-ld/yaml-ld/issues/5">Submitted Use Case</a></p>
        <p>
          As a developer of YAML-LD processors. I want to be able to use off-the-shelf libraries for converting between JSON-LD and YAML-LD serialization formats. So that data produced in JSON-LD can be easily represented in YAML-LD and visa-versa.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          There seems to be general compatibility between YAML libraries that produce equivalent results when serializing data originally parsed from JSON. This should be verified, but indicates an easy way of providing a YAML-LD serialization fully round-trippable with JSON-LD.
